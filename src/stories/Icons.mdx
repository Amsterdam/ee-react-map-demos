# Icons

## In short

- Use `L.icon` if you need a simple, image-based marker.
- Use `L.divIcon` if you need a highly customizable marker with HTML content.

Your choice will depend on whether you prioritize performance and simplicity (`L.icon`) or customization and flexibility (`L.divIcon`). If you need to add dynamic content, animations, or specific styling to your markers, `L.divIcon` is the better option. For static images or less complex markers, `L.icon` is more straightforward and efficient.

## Background

When creating a marker, it is common to replace the default Leaflet marker image. There are two possible replacements:

1. `L.icon` - [docs](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#icon)

```js
var myIcon = L.icon({
  iconUrl: 'my-icon.png',
  iconSize: [38, 95],
  iconAnchor: [22, 94],
  popupAnchor: [-3, -76],
  shadowUrl: 'my-icon-shadow.png',
  shadowSize: [68, 95],
  shadowAnchor: [22, 94]
});
```

In Leaflet, the default image marker has a shadow image, which is aligned according to the sizing options. This shadow can be disabled via setting `shadowUrl` to `null`.

If the marker is created with the `draggable: true` option, the `iconAnchor` option is quite important, as it corresponds with the 'tip of the icon' - where the cursor 'grabs' the marker.

2. `L.divIcon` - [docs](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#divicon)

```js
var myIcon = L.divIcon({
  className: 'my-div-icon',
  html: '<svg height="100" width="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" stroke="green" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /></svg>',
  iconSize: [24, 32],
  iconAnchor: [12, 32],
  popupAnchor: [0, -30],
});
```

The main advantage with the `L.divIcon` is that you can pass it any HTML element. These days icons are often SVG files, which work with CSS styling. Therefore, dynamic styling, such a different background-color on hover, is achievable - and works faster than having to write JS to listen for the `mouseover` event on the marker and then run the associated side-effect.

One disadvantage of this is passing complex HTML elements could lead to a less performant map.
