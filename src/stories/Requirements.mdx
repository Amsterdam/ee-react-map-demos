# Global Requirements

For a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) / [React-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) based map to function, the following two elements are required:

1. The [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) / [React-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library

    `import L from 'leaflet'` or `import { MapContainer } from 'react-leaflet'`
<br />
2. The Leaflet CSS

    `import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';`
<br />
3. The map container (parent DOM element where the Leaflet map will be rendered into) has a defined height. For example:

    `.map-container { height: 180px; }`
